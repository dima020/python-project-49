       asciinema lets you easily record terminal sessions and replay them in a terminal as well as in a web browser.

CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS
       asciinema is composed of multiple commands, similar to git, apt-get or brew.

       When  you run aasscciiiinneemmaa with no arguments help message is displayed, listing all available commands with their
       options.

   rreecc [[_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e]]
       Record terminal session.

       By running aasscciiiinneemmaa rreecc [[ffiilleennaammee]] you start a new recording session.  The command (process) that is recorded
       can be specified with --cc option (see below), and defaults to $$SSHHEELLLL which is what you want in most cases.

       Recording  finishes when you exit the shell (hit Ctrl+D or type exit).  If the recorded process is not a shell
       then recording finishes when the process exits.

       If the _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e argument is omitted then (after asking for confirmation) the resulting asciicast  is  uploaded
       to  asciinema-server  (https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema-server)  (by default to asciinema.org), where it
       can be watched and shared.

       If the _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e argument is given then the resulting recording  (called  asciicast  (doc/asciicast-v2.md))  is
       saved  to  a local file.  It can later be replayed with aasscciiiinneemmaa ppllaayy <<ffiilleennaammee>> and/or uploaded to asciinema
       server with aasscciiiinneemmaa uuppllooaadd <<ffiilleennaammee>>.

       AASSCCIIIINNEEMMAA__RREECC==11 is added to recorded process environment variables.  This can be used by your  shell's  config
       file (.bashrc, .zshrc) to alter the prompt or play a sound when the shell is being recorded.

              --yy,, ----yyeess
                     Answer “yes” to all prompts (e.g. upload confirmation)

              --qq,, ----qquuiieett
                     Be quiet, suppress all notices/warnings (implies --yy)

       Stdin  recording  allows for capturing of all characters typed in by the user in the currently recorded shell.
       This may be used by a player (e.g.  asciinema-player (https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema-player)) to  dis‐
       play pressed keys.  Because it's basically a key-logging (scoped to a single shell instance), it's disabled by
       default, and has to be explicitly enabled via ––ssttddiinn option.

   ppllaayy <<_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e>>
       Replay recorded asciicast in a terminal.

       This command replays given asciicast (as recorded by rreecc command) directly in your terminal.

       Following keyboard shortcuts are available:

              Space - toggle pause,
              . - step through a recording a frame at a time (when paused),
              Ctrl+C - exit.

       Playing from a local file:

   ccaatt <<_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e>>
       Print full output of recorded asciicast to a terminal.

       While  aasscciiiinneemmaa ppllaayy  replays the recorded session using timing information saved in the asciicast, aasscciiiinneemmaa
       ccaatt  dumps the full output (including all escape sequences) to a terminal immediately.

   uuppllooaadd
       Upload recorded asciicast to asciinema.org site.

       This command uploads given asciicast (recorded by rreecc command) to asciinema.org, where it can be  watched  and
       shared.

       review an asciicast before publishing it on asciinema.org.

   aauutthh
       Link your install ID with your asciinema.org user account.

       If you want to manage your recordings (change title/theme, delete) at asciinema.org you need to link your “in‐
       stall ID” with asciinema.org user account.

       This command displays the URL to open in a web browser to do that.  You may be asked to log in first.

       Install  ID  is  a random ID (UUID v4 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier)) generated
       locally when you run asciinema for the first time, and saved at $$HHOOMMEE//..ccoonnffiigg//aasscciiiinneemmaa//iinnssttaallll--iidd.  It's pur‐
       pose  is to connect local machine with uploaded recordings, so they can later be associated with asciinema.org
       account.  This way we decouple uploading from account creation, allowing them to happen in any order.

       Note: A new install ID is generated on each machine and system user account you use asciinema on, so in  order
       to keep all recordings under a single asciinema.org account you need to run aasscciiiinneemmaa aauutthh on all of those ma‐
       chines.

       Note: asciinema versions prior to 2.0 confusingly referred to install ID as “API token”.

EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
       Record your first session:

              asciinema rec first.cast

       Now replay it with double speed:

              asciinema play -s 2 first.cast

       Or with normal speed but with idle time limited to 2 seconds:

              asciinema play -i 2 first.cast

       You can pass --ii 22 to aasscciiiinneemmaa rreecc as well, to set it permanently on a recording.  Idle  time  limiting  makes
       the recordings much more interesting to watch, try it.

       If you want to watch and share it on the web, upload it:

              asciinema upload first.cast

       The    above    uploads    it    to    <https://asciinema.org>,    which   is   a   default   asciinema-server
       (<https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema-server>) instance, and prints a secret link you can use to watch your
       recording in a web browser.

       You can record and upload in one step by omitting the filename:

              asciinema rec

       You'll  be  asked  to  confirm the upload when the recording is done, so nothing is sent anywhere without your
       consent.

       AASSCCIIIINNEEMMAA__AAPPII__UURRLL
              This variable allows overriding asciinema-server URL (which defaults to https://asciinema.org) in  case
              you're running your own asciinema-server instance.

       AASSCCIIIINNEEMMAA__CCOONNFFIIGG__HHOOMMEE
              This  variable allows overriding config directory location.  Default location is $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/asci‐
              inema (when $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is set) or $HOME/.config/asciinema.
